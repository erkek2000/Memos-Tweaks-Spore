## Additional Fixes / Modders' Resources:
- Adds capability for planner categories to have pages
- Adds missing harvester music soundProps
- Adds files for Palette Categories with Subcategories _(see Dark injection, Wordsmith, Pandora, etc)_. These files will no longer need to be included in each mod that uses them, as long as SPUIFF is installed.
- Adds unique VerbTray icons for Large, Medium, and Small plants
- Adds `VerbIcons` folder, which automatically adds all pngs inside as valid `verbIconImageID` entries. This can be used in any mod as long as SPUIFF is installed.

**Spore UI Fixer Framework is compatible with most other UI mods, as it purposefully uses a low priority naming scheme as to be used only as a basis for useful changes, overridden by most others. Mods that directly modify SPUI files will take priority over the ones changed by Fixer Framework.**
